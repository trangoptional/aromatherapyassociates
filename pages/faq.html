          I'm pregnant, what products can I use? <span class="icon">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-desc">
          The only products that we would not recommend would be the Bath &
          Shower Oils. This is simply due to the concentration of the essential
          oils. However please note that as each pregnancy is different, we
          advise you to seek advice from your medical team before use of any
          product.<br />
          Other than that, Aromatherapy Associates offers a range of products
          for the mother-to-be and the new mother. The Rose range are
          particularly recommended to nourish and protect the skin of the
          mother-to-be. The roller balls and mists are great tools to boost your
          mood on the go. Our diffuser the Atomiser and Atomiser Connect for
          undiluted diffusion of our Pure Essential Oil Blends are perfect to
          scent your home for peace and tranquillity.

          <span class="icon">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-desc">
          If you have a nut allergy it is recommended you avoid using the Revive
          Energising Exfoliator, Rose Pink Clay Mask, Rose Indulgent Body Cream
          and the Replenishing Hand & Body Lotion. Please note: Our Pro Barrier
          Boost Face Oil contains Marula Oil. There are no well-documented,
          specific health risks, however people allergic to nuts should be
          advised to be cautious using products containing Marula Oil. As
          always, it would be recommended to complete a patch test before use.
          We have a sample size of the Pro Barrier Boost Face Oil here.

          We create highly potent essential oils blends using the best possible
          ingredients. We choose our product bases wisely too, using vitamin and
          omega-rich plant oils such as Jojoba, Evening Primrose and Artic
          Strawberry Seed Oils and Shea and Murumuru Butters. These have a
          natural affinity with essential oils, allowing them work to their best
          potential.

        <div class="faq-desc">
          Our main area of expertise is aromatherapy, so the aromas will always
          be natural. All our oils are all 100% natural including our Bath &
          Shower Oils, Body Oils, Pure Essential Oils and Face Oils. All our
          other products where possible are natural, however we do not
          compromise on quality, safety and efficacy. We use a limited number of
          naturally derived or synthetic preservative systems such as
          Phenoxyethanol where there are no alternatives. We are proud that our
          products are 100% free from synthetic fragrances, artificial colours,
          sulphates, parabens and mineral oils.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-desc">
          We always try to source the best possible essential oils and
          ingredients. So, while our oils are natural, they are not necessarily
          certified 100% organic because not every natural ingredient is
          certified organic. We also believe, in some cases, there are greater
          benefits from sourcing an ingredient from its natural environment
          rather than from an organic farm. For example, we like to source our
          lavender from the Alps rather than an organic farm in the UK.

          In most of our products we use some Fatty Alcohols which are
          beneficial to the skin, examples include Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl
          Alcohol, Oleyl Alcohol and Stearyl Alcohol. They are not considered to
          be drying to the skin unlike Ethanol and other volatile alcohols.
          Denatured alcohol is occasionally used as a solvent when no
          alternatives are available, for example in our Deep Relax Sleep Mist.

          No, our products are SLS/ SLES free. We do however occasionally use
          milder sulfates to help maintain the efficacy of our products. For
          example, our Shower Oils contain MIPA LaurethSulfate, which has an
          "oilier" molecule and which is milder than SLS/ SLES.
